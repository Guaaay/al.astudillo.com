These rare Apparitions have been occuring for centuries now, with widely documented cases from all around the world. 
They are not formally considered ghosts, but this doesn't stop people from mistaking them as such and walking up to them, disturbing their shapes and blurring them around by flailing their arms and legs around. This will cause these Apparitions to be permanently disturbed, and to remain so every time they happen. The one captured in this photo appears to be in rarely seen good condition, and the viewer will be able to appreciate clearly where the Apparition begins and where it ends. 
We implore people not to alter or get close to these Apparitions, so as to not sully and warp them any more than they already are.
