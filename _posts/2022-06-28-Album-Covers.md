### New Guests - we never got back

New Guests strongly set their foot on the indie rock scene with their debut album "we never got back" - a surprisingly endearing and introspective record full of rich string arrangements and crisp guitars. Frontman Jessie Grold and his partner Rita Hroust weave in and out of creative vocal harmonies that manage to trap the listener's ear for most of the songs, even if becoming a tad overbearing on some of the LP's later tracks.

### Omnes Perit - Tenebris Caelum

Omnes Perit returns after their mysterious 6 year hiatus with no answers and only more questions. To say Tenebris Caelum is a controversial record would be an understatement. Combining aspects of dark metal with trap and experimental hip hop, Omnes Perit has produced an extremely polarizing record - its detractors hate and denounce their violence and sex-filled lyrics, qualifying them as "too much" even for the usually offensive lyrics of the genre, while its most fervent fans revel in the depravity and energy of the profanity-filled tracks.

### Wasped Out - „ÅÑ„Å§„Åß„ÇÇ„Å©„Åì„Åß„ÇÇ (Wherever, Whenever)

Wherever, Whenever is a monumental achievement in japanese math and post-rock, as multi-instrumentalists Shimomura Daisuke and Jinguuji Aiko play nearly every conceivable instrument to bring in innovative sounds, all while cultivating and developing their characteristically introspective sound with occasional vocals acting as another instrument in the mix. Expert performance, deep, thoughtful instrumentation and clean, crisp production make this record a crowning work in the genre.

### Muscle Beach - Spread Out

Muscle Beach's sophomore record weaves a complex tapestry of sounds that marks them as completely unique. Incorporating elements of glitchcore and shoegaze, Spread Out is a record that seems to want to pull itself apart - some songs are deeply calm and reflective, while others kick it up into overdrive and go right into glitch-heavy experimentation characterized by convoluted polyrythmic structures. This is an instant classic record album that will no doubt amass a cult following for years to come.
