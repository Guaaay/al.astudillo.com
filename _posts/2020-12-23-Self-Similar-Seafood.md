They are believed to not have a physical form; although they do interact with each other and leave faint but measurable traces of their presence. 
They seem to not carry out basic reproductive or nutritional activities.
Researchers have yet to closely examine or acquire a specimen for study and dissection.
Happen to spot one? Report it to your local research team and help contribute to our understanding of these peculiar critters.
