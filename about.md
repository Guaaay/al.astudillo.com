Welcome to my page! This blog is intended as a personal place where I can post things I make. Most posts are ripped directly from [my instagram](https://www.instagram.com/gaenial/) using [a tool I made](https://github.com/Guaaay/instatomd) that turns any post I make into markdown for posting on this blog. 

<div class="message">
  Expect most posts to be in spanish - this is a bilingual blog.

## About me

* Coding and math
* Photography
* Creative writing
* 3D and CGI

## Setup

I host it on my private server.
